Circuit Scribe art project step #2
==================================

.. tags:: Circuit-Scribe, Circuit-Scribe-Seattle

I put another hour into this and started sketching out the buildings surrounding the Space Needle. The landscape is starting to take shape, but it lacks any depth. Next I need to figure out where I'm going to route my circuit, and then I'll start drawing some of the details in the buildings.

Also I really need to get my camera to pick up the pencil marks as I'm working. It looks like I'm just zipping all over a black board and doing nothing.
